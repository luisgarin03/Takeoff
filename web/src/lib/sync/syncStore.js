// Annotation reconciler (Slices 4b + 4c) — wraps a per-project local store with
// an optional Drive sync layer so annotations survive across machines while local
// stays canonical. 4b is the PUSH + SEED half; 4c adds the mutable-doc CONFLICT
// half: divergence detection, uniform remote-wins resolution, loser-snapshot, and
// the isBusy() defer-gate that keeps a remote adopt from clobbering in-flight work.
//
// Composition: base = createLocalStore(folderId) (Slice 3), provider = the
// annotation-sync provider (Slice 4a). The RevisionsPanel/canvas call
// store.loadAnnotations/saveAnnotations unaware sync exists.
//
// Invariants (from the reviewed plan + advisor):
//   • Local write is authoritative and NEVER blocks on the network. loadAnnotations
//     returns local instantly and cannot throw a network error into the mount
//     chain. The Drive push is fire-and-forget.
//   • Durable bookkeeping lives in `sync:<folderId>:*` meta keys, each its OWN key
//     (metaGet/metaPut, no composite record) so autosave/push/recovery never
//     lost-update each other.
//   • CRASH-TORN WRITE ORDERING is the correctness spine — every durable write is
//     ordered so a crash mid-sequence fails SAFE:
//       - `touched` is written BEFORE the annotation content. Torn the safe way →
//         touched=true with no content (benign). The reverse (content, no touched)
//         would let the next mount's seed adopt remote over a real edit = silent
//         loss.
//       - the push `marker` {targetRev} is written BEFORE the push; `synced_rev`
//         advances only AFTER a confirmed push; the marker is cleared LAST. On
//         recovery a lingering marker means "verify against Drive", not "trust".
//   • `expectedRev` for a push is ALWAYS the durable `synced_rev`, never a rev
//     carried in the payload — so a restored old snapshot mints synced_rev+1 and
//     pushes clean (why #73 stays retired on the opted-in path).
