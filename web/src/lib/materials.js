// Material library (browser-global `material_library` meta record, #47).
// Like the condition-template record, it's shared across every project in
// the browser, so a single corrupt item would crash the canvas for ALL
// projects at once (matLibById dereferences `m.id` on every entry, and the
// Materials tab keys its rows on it). This sanitizer is the load gate (the
// sanitizeTemplates precedent): store.loadMaterialLibrary() routes through it
// so nothing malformed ever reaches the canvas.
//
// The contract — deliberately minimal ("safe to dereference and key on", not
// a re-implementation of the canvas's defaulting): every returned item is a
// plain object with a non-empty string `id`, unique within the list (entries
// without one, or later duplicates, are dropped — first-wins, the
// sanitizeConditionColumns precedent — since matLibById, the Materials tab's
// row keys, and updateLibMaterial all match on `id`, and a duplicate breaks
// all three). Field defaulting stays libFields' / the tab's `||` fallbacks'
// job. Unknown item fields pass through (the scale_source
// precedent: stripping a future field on load would persist the loss on the
// next library save).
